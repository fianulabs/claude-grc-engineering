# claude-grc-engineering

The official open-source GRC toolkit from the [GRC Engineering Club](https://grcengclub.com) — turning checkbox compliance into engineered systems. It ships as a [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) plugin marketplace: persona plugins for engineers, auditors, internal GRC teams, and TPRM; 20+ framework reference plugins from SOC 2 to FedRAMP to APRA; and thin cloud/SaaS connectors that emit a common Finding contract. Assessors, platform engineers, and GRC teams everywhere end up re-inventing the same pipeline — pull evidence, crosswalk to a framework, generate a gap report, wrestle OSCAL. The Club maintains one toolkit that does the whole pipeline end-to-end without locking anyone into a vendor platform.

```
/grc-engineer:gap-assessment SOC2,FedRAMP-High --sources=aws,github
```

A prioritized, effort-estimated, remediation-linked gap report backed by 1,468 [Secure Controls Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com) controls crosswalked to 249 frameworks.

## Design positions

A few opinionated choices worth naming up front, since they're most of what makes this different from a Vanta or Drata clone.

**SCF is the right crosswalk source.** Most GRC tools roll their own control-mapping tables. They're usually incomplete, and nobody maintains them past the quarter they were built in. SCF has 1,468 controls mapped bidirectionally to 249 frameworks, publishes quarterly, and ships as a static JSON API. The toolkit uses it as the backbone. No hand-maintained CSVs.

**Connectors should be thin.** Platform vendors bundle giant agents that do everything. That's a lock-in pattern, not an engineering pattern. Every connector here is a few hundred lines that shells out to tools teams already have (`aws`, `gcloud`, `gh`, direct Okta API). Any connector can be ripped out and replaced without touching the rest of the toolkit.

**Framework plugins don't reproduce standard text.** ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and HITRUST CSF text is copyrighted. Plenty of GRC tools publish that text inside their product and hope nobody notices. This toolkit references control IDs and ships implementation guidance in paraphrased form. Each team's licensed copy of the standard is the source of truth.

**Vanta, Drata, OneTrust, and Archer are good at what they do.** They're also expensive, slow to extend, and assume a dedicated compliance team. This toolkit is for teams that want the engineering layer without the platform lock-in, and for 3PAOs and assessors who want to cross-check what a platform is reporting.

| Scan Terraform, CloudFormation, or Kubernetes for compliance violations, optionally auto-fix | `/grc-engineer:scan-iac` |
| Validate a control end-to-end: config, functionality, compliance | `/grc-engineer:test-control` |
| Generate remediation (Terraform modules, Python evidence scripts, Rego/Cedar policies) | `/grc-engineer:generate-implementation`, `generate-policy` |
| See one control across every framework it maps to | `/grc-engineer:map-controls-unified` |
| Find conflicting requirements across frameworks, with "most-restrictive wins" resolution | `/grc-engineer:find-conflicts` |
| Optimize multi-framework implementation (satisfy many with one) | `/grc-engineer:optimize-multi-framework` |
| Continuous monitoring with Slack, PagerDuty, or email alerts | `/grc-engineer:monitor-continuous` |
| Check pipeline health: which connectors are configured, last-run, cache freshness | `/grc-engineer:pipeline-status` |
| Review a PR for compliance regressions before merge | `/grc-engineer:review-pr` |

### Connector plugins

Thin integration plugins that wrap an external inspector tool and emit findings matching [`schemas/finding.schema.json`](schemas/finding.schema.json). External tools install separately. `/<tool>:setup` handles install and credential verification.

Tier 1, ship-ready:

| Plugin | Wraps | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **aws-inspector** | `aws` CLI | IAM (root MFA, password policy, access keys), S3, EBS, RDS, CloudTrail, VPC, Security Hub, Config |
| **gcp-inspector** | `gcloud` CLI | IAM, Cloud Storage, Compute, Audit Logs, Security Command Center |
| **github-inspector** | `gh` CLI | branch protections, Actions, secret scanning, deploy keys, Dependabot |
| **okta-inspector** | direct Okta REST API | authentication policies, MFA, session, password, admin factor enrollment |

Tier 2, roadmap: azure, slack, duo, zoom, webex, salesforce, datadog, splunk, sumologic, newrelic, elastic, tenable, qualys, veracode, crowdstrike, paloalto, zscaler, snowflake, box, servicenow, pagerduty, zendesk, launchdarkly, mulesoft, knowbe4.

Want a connector that isn't here? [Contribute one](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). A typical wrapper is around 200 lines.

### OSCAL / FedRAMP plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **oscal** | Wraps [`ethanolivertroy/oscal-cli`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/oscal-cli) (Go rewrite of NIST's oscal-cli): `/oscal:validate`, `/oscal:convert`, `/oscal:ssp-export` |
| **fedramp-ssp** | Wraps [`ethanolivertroy/frdocx-to-froscal-ssp`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/frdocx-to-froscal-ssp): DOCX SSP to OSCAL 1.2.0 SSP conversion |
| **compliance-trestle** | Wraps [`ethanolivertroy/compliance-trestle-skills`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/compliance-trestle-skills) for OSCAL authoring (roadmap) |
| **fedramp-docs** | MCP integration with [`ethanolivertroy/fedramp-docs-mcp`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/fedramp-docs-mcp) for live FedRAMP documentation search (roadmap) |
| **vanta-bridge** | `/vanta:export-evidence` using `vanta-go-export` to pull Vanta evidence and normalize to Findings (roadmap) |

The OSCAL tooling plugins wrap independent upstream projects maintained outside the Club. Their attribution stays with the original authors; the plugin wrappers are part of this toolkit.

## The data contract

Every connector emits Findings matching [`schemas/finding.schema.json`](schemas/finding.schema.json). One Finding is one resource with one or more control evaluations. Example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "source": "github-inspector",
  "source_version": "0.4.1",
  "run_id": "01HXKJTSZPWX7Z1T8E8RQRN5QX",
  "collected_at": "2026-04-13T15:04:05Z",
  "resource": {
    "type": "github_repository",
    "id": "acme/prod-api",
    "uri": "https://github.com/acme/prod-api"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "control_framework": "SCF",
      "control_id": "CHG-02",
      "status": "fail",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Main branch has no protection rule. Direct pushes allowed.",
      "remediation": {
        "summary": "Enable branch protection on main with required reviews.",
        "ref": "grc-engineer://generate-implementation/change_management/github",
        "effort_hours": 0.25,
        "automation": "auto_fixable"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The contract is versioned. Consumers pin a major version. Contract tests run in CI for every connector.

## How the crosswalk works

SCF is the canonical control vocabulary. 1,468 SCF controls map bidirectionally to 249 frameworks. When a connector reports an SCF control failure, `/gap-assessment` expands it into every requested framework via the crosswalk.

SCF data is fetched from [`hackidle.github.io/scf-api`](https://hackidle.github.io/scf-api/) and cached locally. Licensing (CC BY-ND 4.0): the toolkit fetches and redistributes verbatim, never modified. See [`docs/SCF-ATTRIBUTION.md`](docs/SCF-ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Enterprise deployment

The toolkit runs on any Claude Code model backend. For enterprise data residency or compliance requirements, point Claude Code at AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI:

```bash
# AWS Bedrock (FedRAMP High available in GovCloud)
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Google Vertex AI (FedRAMP High as of October 2025)
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```
