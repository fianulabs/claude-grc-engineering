# claude-grc-engineering

I've worked both sides of FedRAMP: years as a 3PAO assessor, and I build open-source GRC tooling for the teams stuck doing the work by hand. Every team I've assessed ends up re-inventing the same pipeline: pull evidence from AWS, GitHub, GCP, and Okta; map it to SOC 2 or NIST 800-53 or FedRAMP Moderate; generate a gap report; fight with OSCAL. I wanted one toolkit that did the whole pipeline end-to-end without bolting me into a vendor platform. This is it.

Install as a [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) plugin. Run:

```
/grc-engineer:gap-assessment SOC2,FedRAMP-Moderate --sources=aws,github
```

You get a prioritized, effort-estimated, remediation-linked gap report backed by 1,468 [Secure Controls Framework](https://securecontrolsframework.com) controls crosswalked to 249 frameworks.

## What I'm taking a position on

A few opinionated design choices worth naming up front, since they're most of what makes this different from a Vanta or Drata clone.

**SCF is the right crosswalk source.** Everyone rolls their own control-mapping tables. They're usually incomplete, and nobody maintains them past the quarter they were built in. SCF has 1,468 controls mapped bidirectionally to 249 frameworks, publishes quarterly, and ships as a static JSON API. Use it as the backbone. Stop hand-maintaining CSVs.

**Connectors should be thin.** Most GRC platforms bundle giant agents that do everything. That's a vendor lock-in pattern, not an engineering pattern. Every connector here is a few hundred lines that shells out to tools you already have (`aws`, `gcloud`, `gh`, direct Okta API). You can rip and replace any of them without touching the rest of the toolkit.

**Framework plugins don't reproduce standard text.** ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and HITRUST CSF text is copyrighted. Plenty of GRC tools publish that text inside their product and hope nobody notices. This toolkit references control IDs and ships implementation guidance in my own words. Your licensed copy of the standard is the source of truth.

**Vanta, Drata, OneTrust, and Archer are good at what they do.** They're also expensive, slow to extend, and assume you have a compliance team. This is for teams that want the engineering layer without the platform lock-in, and for 3PAOs and assessors who want to cross-check what a platform is reporting.

### Connector plugins

Thin integration plugins that wrap an external inspector tool and emit findings matching [`schemas/finding.schema.json`](schemas/finding.schema.json). External tools install separately. `/<tool>:setup` handles install and credential verification.

Tier 1, ship-ready:

| Plugin | Wraps | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **aws-inspector** | `aws` CLI | IAM (root MFA, password policy, access keys), S3, EBS, RDS, CloudTrail, VPC, Security Hub, Config |
| **gcp-inspector** | `gcloud` CLI | IAM, Cloud Storage, Compute, Audit Logs, Security Command Center |
| **github-inspector** | `gh` CLI | branch protections, Actions, secret scanning, deploy keys, Dependabot |
| **okta-inspector** | direct Okta REST API | authentication policies, MFA, session, password, admin factor enrollment |

Tier 2, roadmap: azure, slack, duo, zoom, webex, salesforce, datadog, splunk, sumologic, newrelic, elastic, tenable, qualys, veracode, crowdstrike, paloalto, zscaler, snowflake, box, servicenow, pagerduty, zendesk, launchdarkly, mulesoft, knowbe4.

Want a connector that isn't here? [Contribute one](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). A typical wrapper is around 200 lines.

### OSCAL / FedRAMP plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **oscal** | Wraps [`ethanolivertroy/oscal-cli`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/oscal-cli) (Go rewrite of NIST's oscal-cli): `/oscal:validate`, `/oscal:convert`, `/oscal:ssp-export` |
| **fedramp-ssp** | Wraps [`ethanolivertroy/frdocx-to-froscal-ssp`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/frdocx-to-froscal-ssp): DOCX SSP to OSCAL 1.2.0 SSP conversion |
| **compliance-trestle** | Wraps [`ethanolivertroy/compliance-trestle-skills`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/compliance-trestle-skills) for OSCAL authoring (roadmap) |
| **fedramp-docs** | MCP integration with [`ethanolivertroy/fedramp-docs-mcp`](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/fedramp-docs-mcp) for live FedRAMP documentation search (roadmap) |
| **vanta-bridge** | `/vanta:export-evidence` using `vanta-go-export` to pull Vanta evidence and normalize to Findings (roadmap) |

## The data contract

Every connector emits Findings matching [`schemas/finding.schema.json`](schemas/finding.schema.json). One Finding is one resource with one or more control evaluations. Example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "source": "github-inspector",
  "source_version": "0.4.1",
  "run_id": "01HXKJTSZPWX7Z1T8E8RQRN5QX",
  "collected_at": "2026-04-13T15:04:05Z",
  "resource": {
    "type": "github_repository",
    "id": "acme/prod-api",
    "uri": "https://github.com/acme/prod-api"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "control_framework": "SCF",
      "control_id": "CHG-02",
      "status": "fail",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Main branch has no protection rule. Direct pushes allowed.",
      "remediation": {
        "summary": "Enable branch protection on main with required reviews.",
        "ref": "grc-engineer://generate-implementation/change_management/github",
        "effort_hours": 0.25,
        "automation": "auto_fixable"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The contract is versioned. Consumers pin a major version. Contract tests run in CI for every connector.

## How the crosswalk works

SCF is the canonical control vocabulary. 1,468 SCF controls map bidirectionally to 249 frameworks. When a connector reports an SCF control failure, `/gap-assessment` expands it into every requested framework via the crosswalk.

SCF data is fetched from [`hackidle.github.io/scf-api`](https://hackidle.github.io/scf-api/) and cached locally. Licensing (CC BY-ND 4.0): I fetch and redistribute verbatim, never modify. See [`docs/SCF-ATTRIBUTION.md`](docs/SCF-ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Enterprise deployment

The toolkit runs on any Claude Code model backend. For enterprise data residency or compliance requirements, point Claude Code at AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI:

```bash
# AWS Bedrock (FedRAMP High available in GovCloud)
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Google Vertex AI (FedRAMP Moderate)
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```
